Build tools in Jenkins: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Ite-1pEU8

Good syntax for us to use: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/


DSL is a 'Domain Specific Lanuge)...like Groovy

To get Environment Variables you can use in your file:
localhost:8800/env-vars.html/

To create/Use Credentials for refference in your jenkins file, you gotta add them to jenkins
in the Credentials section, under Managae Credentials. Use that ID for reffrence in your file

For the tools section, go to 'Global Tool Configuration' to make sure they're configured properly

I installed the Golang tool, along with a few other stuff for Kubernetes

Good note on how to do stuff with Jenkins Go: https://bmuschko.com/blog/go-on-jenkins/

I used this project with my github account instead of git. HEre's how to create a 
credntial for it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61105368/how-to-use-github-personal-access-token-in-jenkins/61105369#61105369

You might need to delete previous build repositories in order for stuf like mod init or whatever to work

For groovy scripts, all of the variables are accessible in Groovy AND Jenkins

Use the 'replay' button in jenkins to execute very quick changes to your jenkins configurations

In order to run some groovy files, Jenkins might need to approve those Java methods...not sure at all why. Sometimes 
it works, sometimes it dosen't, and there's no easy way to just let these through...
