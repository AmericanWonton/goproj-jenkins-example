Good syntax for us to use: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/

To restart Jenkins Service: sudo service jenkins restart


DSL is a 'Domain Specific Lanuge)...like Groovy

To get Environment Variables you can use in your file:
localhost:8800/env-vars.html/

To create/Use Credentials for refference in your jenkins file, you gotta add them to jenkins

You might need to delete previous build repositories in order for stuf like mod init or whatever to work

For groovy scripts, all of the variables are accessible in Groovy AND Jenkins

Use the 'replay' button in jenkins to execute very quick changes to your jenkins configurations

In order to run some groovy files, Jenkins might need to approve those Java methods...not sure at all why. Sometimes 
it works, sometimes it dosen't, and there's no easy way to just let these through...
